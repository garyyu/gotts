# Gotts

Gotts is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol but with explicit amount transaction, and could be the 1st blockchain for non-collateralized stablecoins, based of [Grin `v2.0.0` Codebase](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/tree/v2.0.0).

Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Decentralized non-collateralized stable-coins, with perfect stability, as Gotts on-chain assets.
  * Transaction as immediate conversion between different stable-coins assets.
  * Follow MimbleWimble protocol, but with explicit amount transaction.
  * Support both interactive and non-interactive transaction.
  * Address and transaction proof.
  * 10x transaction throughput comparing to Grin.
  * Proof of Work.
  * Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.

## Philosophy

Gotts likes itself small and easy on the eyes. It wants to be inclusive and welcoming for all walks of life, without judgement. Gotts is terribly ambitious, but not at the detriment of others, rather to further us all. It may have strong opinions to stay in line with its objectives, which doesn't mean disrespect of others' ideas.

We believe in pull requests, data and scientific research. We do not believe in unfounded beliefs.
